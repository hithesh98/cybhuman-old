      Hey, my name is Hithesh. I explore how humans and computers interact in
      the age of AI. Currently, I am building <a
        href={"https://www.basepod.ai/"}
        target="_blank">Basepod</a
      >, a project experimenting at the intersection of collective intelligence,
      new forms of HCI and media. I co-founded <a
        href={"https://twitter.com/AlgoveraAI"}
        target="_blank">Algovera</a
      >, and led the product team consisting of three senior ML engineers. Iâ€™ve
      been fortunate to be part of the <a
        href={"https://www.tcd.ie/tangent/programmes/accelerators/launchbox/"}
        target="_blank">LaunchBox</a
      > and <a href={"https://www.kernel.community/en/"} target="_blank"
        >Kernel</a
      > communities. I grew up and live in Ireland but make periodic visits to SF.
      I completed my undergrad at Trinity College Dublin and pursued MSc in Computer
      Science at University of Bath.
